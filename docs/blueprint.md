## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(49, 79%, 50%) // RGB(243, 173, 23). Inspired by saffron robes and a desire for calm, this vibrant hue evokes devotion.
- Background color: HSL(49, 20%, 94%) // RGB(249, 246, 237).  This provides a soft, non-distracting canvas for content.
- Accent color: HSL(19, 79%, 50%) // RGB(243, 91, 23). Used for highlights and calls to action to guide the user without jarring the senses.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for excellent clarity and modern aesthetics. Inter provides a very readable font at almost any size.
- Material 3 icons for visual consistency across the app. Phosphor Icons are a good fit for more unique icons.
- Use responsive layout widgets (Expanded, Flexible, LayoutBuilder) for adaptability to different screen sizes and densities.
- Subtle page transition animations for a fluid and polished navigation experience.
